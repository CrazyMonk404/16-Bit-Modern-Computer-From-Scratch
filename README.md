In this Project we are using HDL(Hardware Descriptive Language) to stimulate all the hardware we need to build this computer and Basic programing language to build the software part.
This computer will be able to perform operations and you can further build basic applications and games from 90's on it but for the sake of simplicity I am building the the basic of everything.

## Step by Step Guide towards the 16-Bit Computer
To make it simple we are building this computer in modules and these modules with their steps are uploaded in Module folder's.
